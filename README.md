# GreenBot: A Friendly Chatbot
### GreenBot is a friendly chatbot built using the Microsoft DialoGPT-large model and tokenizer. 
### It allows users to engage in conversations on various topics in a natural and engaging manner.

## Features
`User-Friendly Interface`: GreenBot provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with.
`Responsive Conversations`: The chatbot generates responses based on user input and maintains context throughout the conversation.
`Easy to Deploy`: GreenBot can be easily deployed using Gradio and Hugging Face's deployment platform.
`Note on Performance`: Due to the use of the free, CPU-based Microsoft DialoGPT-large model, the app's speed may be lower compared to models running on more powerful hardware. 
Consider switching to a model from OpenAI or Hugging Face for improved performance.
